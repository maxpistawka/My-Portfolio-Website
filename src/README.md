 I decided to code this website as a challange to create a web application fully from scratch using technologies I was foreign to at the start of the process. If you have any suggestions on how you would like to see the layout change I would love to hear them.

 # Technologies Used
The language used for this project was TypeScript, using React to aid the front-end development. For styling, TailwindCSS was used as the primary source, however, some specific styling utilized pure CSS. Vite was used as a starter pack, and the application was deployed using Vercel (a hosting service). All animations seen on the web page are executed using FramerMotion.
